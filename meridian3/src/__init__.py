"""
Rover Simulation System - Main Package

This package contains the complete rover simulation and telemetry pipeline system.
It is organized into three main subsystems:
    - simulator: Core rover physics, sensors, and environment modeling
    - pipeline: Telemetry processing, corruption, cleaning, and anomaly detection
    - utils: Shared utilities for timing, math, and visualization

Teaching Purpose:
    Demonstrates professional Python package organization and modular architecture.
    Shows how to separate concerns into logical subsystems that can evolve independently.
