Shared utilities used across the simulation and pipeline:
    - timing: Mission time, orbital cycles, timestep management
    - math_helpers: Drift, smoothing, noise generation, interpolation
    - plotting: Visualization helpers for telemetry and diagnostics

Teaching Purpose:
    Shows how to extract common functionality into reusable utilities.
    Demonstrates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    Provides examples of well-documented helper functions.
