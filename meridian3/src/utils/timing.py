"""
Timing Utilities - Mission Time Management

PURPOSE:
    Provides utilities for managing mission time, converting between different
    time representations (Earth time, Mars sols, local solar time), and
    handling timestep logic for simulation.

TEACHING GOALS:
    - Time system conversions
    - Orbital mechanics basics
    - Timestep management in simulations
    - Time zone / calendar concepts

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION: Phase 2
